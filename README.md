# 🗃️ SQL App – AI-Powered Query Interface

This project demonstrates a smart SQL application built using **Streamlit** and **Generative AI**, allowing users to run SQL queries on a sample database—possibly even using natural language as input. Developed during the **GenAI Workshop**, it showcases how AI can simplify and enhance data interaction for users with or without SQL expertise.
